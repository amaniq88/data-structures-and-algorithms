Insert Before 
![Insert Before method whitboard ](./insert_before.jpg)

## Approach & Efficiency
creat a Node and Linkedlist classes 
methods used  
1- Append New Node to the End
2- Insert New Node at the Head
3- Inser New Node Before Certain value 
4- Insert New Node After Certain Value
5- Includes Function to check if the value is there or Not   


## Solution
Two Classes Created  Node , Linked LIst 
Node Has Two vlaue , data of the Node and the NetValue 
Linked List pointed to the Head value and initail it to None At the creation ,
